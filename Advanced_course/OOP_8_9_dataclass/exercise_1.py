# You have been asked to create a simple inventory management system for a small retail store.
#  You need to define a Product class using the dataclass module that represents a product in
#   the store. Each Product should have a unique ID, a name, a description, a price, and a
#   quantity in  stock. You also need to implement a method calculate_total_cost that calculates
#   the total cost of a given number of items of the product, taking into account any discounts
#   that may apply.

from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class Product:
    id: int
    name: str
    description: str
    price: float
    quantity: int

    def calculate_total_cost(self, number_of_items) -> float:
        return self.price * number_of_items


product1 = Product(id=1, name="Mango", description="Didelis", price=1.00, quantity=20)

print(product1.calculate_total_cost(number_of_items=3))

from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Optional


@dataclass
class Product:
    id: int
    name: str
    description: str
    price: float
    quantity: int

    def calculate_total_cost(self, number_of_items: Optional[int] = None) -> float:
        if number_of_items is None:
            return self.price * self.quantity
        else:
            return self.price * number_of_items


product1 = Product(id=1, name="Mango", description="Didelis", price=1.00, quantity=20)

print(product1.calculate_total_cost(number_of_items=3))
print(product1.calculate_total_cost())
